# AMR Pipeline Project

This project implements a reproducible bioinformatics pipeline for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling from bacterial whole-genome sequencing data. It supports both Illumina and Nanopore datasets and is built for execution on an HPC platform using **Nextflow** with **Docker**, **SLURM**, and object storage integration.

---

## 🚀 Objectives

- Perform quality control, assembly, and AMR annotation on mock bacterial genomes
- Compare AMR profiles between Illumina and Nanopore platforms
- Export results in a structured format suitable for downstream analysis
- Develop a scalable architecture for deployment in a lakehouse-based data platform

# AMR Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This repo contains a reproducible workflow for AMR detection from bacterial genome sequences using both Illumina and Nanopore data.

## Contents
- `workflow/`: Main pipeline (Nextflow/Snakemake) with configs
- `documentation/`: Reports, diagrams, pitch deck
- `results/`: Output directories per platform
- `slurm/`: SLURM example scripts
- `scripts/`: Helper tools

## How to Run
1. Pull required containers: `docker pull ...` or build from Dockerfile
2. Run the pipeline:
```bash
nextflow run workflow/main.nf -profile docker,slurm
